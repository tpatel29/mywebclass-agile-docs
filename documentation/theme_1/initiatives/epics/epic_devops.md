# Epic: Creating a CI/CD environment

## Description:
The epic is focused on creating a CI/CD environment for the website development project. The goal is to automate the software delivery process, increase the quality and reliability of the website, and enable frequent and consistent releases.

## Goals:
The primary goals of this epic are as follows:

* Create a CI/CD environment for the website development project.
* Automate the software delivery process.

* Availability of the website development project code and repository.
* Availability of DevOps experts.

## Risks:
* Inadequate knowledge and experience in DevOps technologies and tools.
* Inadequate testing of the CI/CD environment, which can lead to deployment failures.
* Delays in the development process due to issues with the CI/CD environment.

## Estimated Effort:
* Identification of the required hardware and software resources - 1 week
* Identification of the required DevOps technologies and tools - 2 weeks
* Design and development of the CI/CD environment - 8 weeks
* Integration and testing of the CI/CD environment with the website development project - 4 weeks
* Refinement and improvement of the CI/CD environment - 2 weeks

## Business Value:
The CI/CD environment is critical to the timely and reliable delivery of the website. Therefore, the priority of this epic should be high. The automation of the software delivery process will also reduce the manual effort required, resulting in cost savings for the project.
